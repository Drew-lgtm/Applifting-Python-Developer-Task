Read me file for Flask RestApi project for Applifting.
Code in the project is based on Jose Salivierra's course on Udemy:https://www.udemy.com/course/rest-api-flask-and-python/

Description:
Simple Flask RestApi project used to create, read, update and delete records in the database. I recommend Postman. You will find the necessary modules in the reuirements.txt file. 


How to run project:
1) Run create_tables.py 
2) Run app.py with Python
3) Acces the addres 127.0.0.1:5000 - I suggest using Postman
4) Use Postman (or any simillar app) to test CRUD
5) Use database software to check if all the changes were made to the database (use SQLite or any other database reader)
6) Enjoy

Uploaded to github via GIT.
