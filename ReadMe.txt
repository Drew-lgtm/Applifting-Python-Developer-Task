Read me file for simple Flask RestApi project.

Code in the project is based on Jose Salivierra's course on Udemy:https://www.udemy.com/course/rest-api-flask-and-python/

1) Run create_tables.py 
2) Run app.py with Python
3) Acces the addres 127.0.0.1:5000 - I suggest using Postman
4) Use Postman (or any simillar app) to test CRUD
5) Use database software to check if all the changes were made to the database (use SQLite or any other database reader)
